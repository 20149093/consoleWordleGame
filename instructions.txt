    DEFINE a list of 5-letter words (word_list)

    RANDOMLY SELECT a secret word from the list (secret_word)

    DEFINE a function called give_feedback(guess, secret)
        INITIALIZE an empty string called feedback
        FOR each letter at position i (from 0 to 4)
            IF guess[i] is equal to secret[i]
                ADD "[âœ“] LETTER" to feedback (letter in uppercase)
            ELSE IF guess[i] is in secret
                ADD "[!] LETTER" to feedback (letter in uppercase)
            ELSE
                ADD "[X] LETTER" to feedback (letter in uppercase)
        RETURN feedback without trailing spaces

    ASK the user for their name and convert it to uppercase
    DISPLAY a welcome message and explain the game

    FOR attempt from 1 to 6
        ASK the user to enter a 5-letter word (guess) and convert it to lowercase

        IF guess is not 5 letters long OR contains non-alphabetic characters
            DISPLAY error message for invalid length or characters
            CONTINUE to the next attempt

        IF guess is not in the valid word list
            DISPLAY message that the word is not valid
            CONTINUE to the next attempt

        CALL the function give_feedback with guess and secret_word
        DISPLAY the feedback result

        IF guess is equal to secret_word
            DISPLAY victory message
            END the game

    IF the word was not guessed in 6 attempts
        DISPLAY loss message and reveal the secret word
